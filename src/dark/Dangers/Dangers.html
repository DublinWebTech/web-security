                    Oxford Languages definition: the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by
                    sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Cyberbullying spreads in social medias
                    due to the
                    anonymity they offer. Jokes, threats, any comment having an intimidating or threatening nature is
                    considered cyberbullying. How to fight cyberbullying: on social medias there is often a “block”
                    option where you
                    can prevent any cyberbullies from messaging you, there are also numbers you can text to help you
                    with your case (for example 50808).

                    One of the worst dangers of the Internet, for many parents, is the idea that pornography could pop
                    up and surprise their children. But parents may not realize that some kids are going online to seek
                    out web porn,
                    too.

                    Hacking is a term for designing the theft of digital information such as passwords, softwares,
                    hardwares, etc… definition by oxford language: the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a
                    system or computer.
                    There are several ways to get hacked, the most common is to get infected by a computer virus when
                    opening a shady website or application. How to prevent getting hacked: first you need to beware of
                    shady emails
                    asking you to click a link, second you need to be cautious with what you download on the internet.

                    These days sexual and other predators often stalk children on the internet, taking advantage of
                    their innocence, lack of adult supervision and abusing their trust. This can culminate in children
                    being lured into
                    dangerous personal encounters IRL. These predators lurk on social media and gaming platforms that
                    appeal to children the same virtual venues where anonymity facilitates cyber bullying.

                    The internet does not have a "Delete" key. Things that happen online, stay online. Forever. Anything
                    your child puts online is nearly impossible to remove later. The dangers of social media are
                    especially
                    daunting. It is hard for teenagers in particular to consider how a party picture or Snapchat message
                    could cause problems ten years down the road when they interview for a new job, or how a prospective
                    mate might
                    respond to personal content that they post to their social media profiles or other websites.

                    Is what cyber security professionals call the use of emails that try to trick people into clicking
                    on malicious links or attachments. These can be especially difficult for kids to detect because
                    often, the email
                    will appear to be from someone legitimate, like a friend or family member, saying simply, "Hey
                    thought you might like this!" This can also be done with using messaging apps or text messages

                    Children are probably not going to fall for Nigerian princes offering them a million dollars, but
                    they might fall for scams that offer things they value, such as free access to online games or
                    special features.
                    Young people are easy marks for scams because they have not yet learned to be wary. As with
                    phishing, cyber criminals can use sites popular with children to identify potential victims, and
                    then promise prizes in
                    return for what they want like parents' credit card information.

                    Is a huge issue online, as the internet has provided thieves with more ways than ever to steal
                    private identifying information. Children are among the most common targets for identity theft
                    because of their clean
                    records, so you should always be on the lookout for warning signs that your own child has been
                    targeted.
