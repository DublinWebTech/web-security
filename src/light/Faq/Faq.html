      <br>

    <h1>How to be aware of phishing/ smishing/ scam ?</h1>
    <p>
      Be aware of everything you receive if it's not registered on your device, even if it seems to be from a friend or a family member. If you are not sure, ask them if they sent you this to be sure. 
      <br>
      Be careful with the links you click on, if you are not sure, don't click on it or use tools to authentify it.
      <br>
      You can see if there is a lot of mistakes in the text, if it's not the case, it's probably a scam because real organisations are really careful about this.
      <br>
      Also never give any personal informations such as your bank account number, your address, your phone number, your email, your password, etc.

Immediately change the passwords on your online accounts, and notify the fraud
department at the institution that was mimicked. Request your credit report from the
three main credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian and TranUnion (Equifax.com or
800-525-6285; Experian.com or 888-397-3742; TransUnion.com or 800-680-7289). The
reports are free to victims of identity theft. You can also request free reports from all three
agencies at www.AnnualCreditReport.com. </p>

      <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
        <p class="faq-text">
Today most laptops have the ability to connect to wireless Internet networks (wi-fi). These
can be found in public places such as coffee shops, airports, hotels, etc. Be cautious about
entering personal information on a website when using public wi-fi. Avoid entering credit
card numbers, bank account numbers or passwords while using public wi-fi. If you must
enter a password or payment card number while using a public wireless network, make
sure the Web address begins with https: (the “s” stands for secure). Turn off your wireless
connection when you’re not using it.</p>

      <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
        <p class="faq-text">
Never click on, or copy and paste, links that are sent to you by people or companies
you don’t know. If you want to verify that the site is legitimate, type (don’t copy) the
homepage portion of the URL (ending with .com or .net, etc.) directly into your browser
address bar. When doing an online search, visit only results that are well known and
trusted sources of information.</p>

      <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
        <p class="faq-text">
Some people commit malicious acts with no other goal than to create problems for
others. Theft, on the other hand, generally has the goal of financial gain through the use of the stolen information.
