                it.

                Do not reply to the email and of everything you receive if it's not already registered on your device,
                even
                if it seems to be from a friend or a family member. If you are not sure, ask them if they sent you this
                to
                be sure.
                <br>
                Be careful with the links you click on, if you are not sure, don't click on it or use tools to
                authentify
                it.
                <br>
                You can see if there is a lot of mistakes in the text, if it's not the case, it's probably a scam
                because
                real organisations are really careful about this.
                <br>
                Also never give any personal informations such as your bank account number, your address, your phone
                number,
                your email, your password, etc.</p>

                Immediately change the passwords on your online accounts, and notify the fraud
                department at the institution that was mimicked. Request your credit report from the
                three main credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian and TranUnion (Equifax.com or
                800-525-6285; Experian.com or 888-397-3742; TransUnion.com or 800-680-7289). The
                reports are free to victims of identity theft. You can also request free reports from all three
                agencies at www.AnnualCreditReport.com. </p>

            <p class=faq-heading>What precautions should I take when using public wi-fi?</p>
            <div class=faq-arrow></div>
            <p class=faq-text>
                Today most laptops have the ability to connect to wireless Internet networks (wi-fi). These
                can be found in public places such as coffee shops, airports, hotels, etc. Be cautious about
                entering personal information on a website when using public wi-fi. Avoid entering credit
                card numbers, bank account numbers or passwords while using public wi-fi. If you must
                enter a password or payment card number while using a public wireless network, make
                sure the Web address begins with https: (the “s” stands for secure). Turn off your wireless
                connection when you’re not using it.</p>

            <div class=faq-arrow></div>
            <p class=faq-text>
                Never click on, or copy and paste, links that are sent to you by people or companies
                you don’t know. If you want to verify that the site is legitimate, type (don’t copy) the
                homepage portion of the URL (ending with .com or .net, etc.) directly into your browser
                address bar. When doing an online search, visit only results that are well known and
                trusted sources of information.</p>

            <p class=faq-heading>Why would someone want to steal or damage the data on my computer?</p>
            <div class=faq-arrow></div>
            <p class=faq-text>
                Some people commit malicious acts with no other goal than to create problems for
                others. Theft, on the other hand, generally has the goal of financial gain through the use of the stolen
                information.
