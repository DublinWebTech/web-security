# SPRINT 1

Hello, we will explain you why we chose this specific topic of the dangers of internet for our website. 
So there is more and more people every day using internet, more industry and sectos are using it, people using it are younger than the past decade and will continue as so. 
Our duty is to sensibilies, prevent and make sure that as much people as possible are aware of those dangers coming from either other people or even themselves while being unaware of it. 
People by coming on our website will be able to discover every dangers yet existing in our world of new tech and be aware of them also knowing how to prevent them from happening to be safer and protecting their family.


The main page is designed to, first, briefly introduce the notion of internet dangers and then give a starting point to learn the basics of internet safety by presenting four of the main threats that come with use of the internet (presented in a grid format). If the user wants to look further into it we redirect them to a page with further information. To help with navigating through the different pages of our website each page has a header with a navigation bar letting them return to the main page at all times, find the footer and, in the case of the main page, navigate through the different sections within the page. Every page contains the same footer containing three different ways to contact us (email address, phone number and physical address) as well as our terms of use and our privacy policy. The dangers page contains a three by three grid presenting more of the most common dangers linked to the internet. If you click on one of the dangers, whether on the main page or on the dangers pages, a pop-up will appear with information regarding the problem. The terms of use page is pretty classic in its presentation and contains our terms of use with titles separating the paragraphs of the different rubrics, paragraphs that are themselves framed inside blue rectangles. The privacy policy page resembles the terms of use page in its presentation in the way that each paragraph of the different rubrics is separated by said rubric’s title and framed inside a blue rectangle.

We decided to break down our project in different steps using the agile method, meaning that the main steps of our project are: 
1) Planning, meaning brainstorming and defining our objectives.
2) Designing, meaning visualizing how we want our website to look.
3) Developing, which will itself be divided into tasks in a todo list with each task attributed to someone.
4) Testing to see if there are any bugs in our code.
5) Deploying our website, meaning, in our case, presenting it to our teacher.
6) Gathering reviews, in our case our teacher’s review.
After step number six we will go back to step 1 if there are improvements to make in our project. After each iteration of that loop we will write a report presenting our website and the improvements it has undergone since its last version, a global feedback of the difficulties our team has faced and our work organization and a personal feedback for each of our team members containing our feelings on our work and our team. We chose to proceed according to the agile method because it appeared pretty classic in its structure and we understood immediately what each step meant, which would be greatly important when choosing a methodology for our project management. In order to make our project happen we needed an efficient method of management and because it was easy enough to put in place and simple enough for us to understand we chose the agile method. During our tasks repartition for the development of our website we first created a todo list with Trello then we started with giving the most important tasks to Maxime Caville because he had the most experience with html and css. Of course he didn’t do everything, we let Romain Compagnon and Simon Dessay-Devillards make the main page’s header because they already had that skillset, Romain Compagnon wrote the texts for both the terms of use and the privacy policy while Sandarisoa Rakotovelo coded the two pages and put the aforementioned texts inside, Romain Compagnon and Simon Dessay-Devillards coded to make the website responsive because they wanted to get comfortable with that new skill, Maxime Caville and Romain Compagnon coded the header for the dangers page because they already knew how to, Sandarisoa Rakotovelo coded the header for both the terms of use and privacy policy pages because he could and Maxime Caville, Romain Compagnon and Sandarisoa Rakotovelo made the footer present on all pages. The rest of the coding was made by Maxime Caville.

This site is for the danger of internet.

We decided to choose a dark font for the site with white letter. The button are more darker than the font.

For the Header we put 3 button : The introduction, Dangers and Help. The button introduction send you in the middle of the page, where there is a text that introduce to the danger. The danger button send you to a page where there is a description of each danger. The button help send you to the footer of the page.

On the footer you have the contact and term of use and policy. You have two link that send you to the term of use and an other link that send you to the policy privacy.

For the page of danger, we created a page, then we put case with the name of the danger with an illustration. When you click on the case, a text appear, it describes the danger.The repository is constructed as follows: first a folder named “assets” containing the folder inside which are stored all the css files and another folder containing all of the images used, then the readme file containing this report, then all the html files (in that order: “dangers”, “index”, “privacy policy”, “terms of use”). The naming convention our team chose for our files and our code is the snake case convention which consists in replacing the spaces with underscores and not capitalizing any words.
